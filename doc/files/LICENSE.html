            <pre>          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#x000A;             Version 2.1, February 1999&#x000A;&#x000A;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#x000A;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA&#x000A;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#x000A;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#x000A;&#x000A;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#x000A;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#x000A;the version number 2.1.]&#x000A;&#x000A;                          Preamble&#x000A;&#x000A;    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#x000A;  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#x000A;  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#x000A;  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#x000A;&#x000A;    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#x000A;  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#x000A;  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#x000A;  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#x000A;  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#x000A;  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#x000A;&#x000A;    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#x000A;  not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#x000A;  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#x000A;  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#x000A;  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#x000A;  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#x000A;  these things.&#x000A;&#x000A;    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#x000A;  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#x000A;  rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#x000A;  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#x000A;&#x000A;    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#x000A;  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#x000A;  you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#x000A;  code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#x000A;  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#x000A;  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#x000A;  it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#x000A;&#x000A;    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#x000A;  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#x000A;  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#x000A;&#x000A;    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#x000A;  there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#x000A;  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#x000A;  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#x000A;  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#x000A;  introduced by others.&#x000A;&#x000A;    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#x000A;  any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#x000A;  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#x000A;  restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#x000A;  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#x000A;  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#x000A;&#x000A;    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#x000A;  ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#x000A;  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#x000A;  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#x000A;  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#x000A;  libraries into non-free programs.&#x000A;&#x000A;    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#x000A;  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#x000A;  combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#x000A;  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#x000A;  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#x000A;  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#x000A;  the library.&#x000A;&#x000A;    We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#x000A;  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General&#x000A;  Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#x000A;  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#x000A;  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#x000A;  libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#x000A;  special circumstances.&#x000A;&#x000A;    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#x000A;  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#x000A;  a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#x000A;  allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#x000A;  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#x000A;  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#x000A;  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#x000A;&#x000A;    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#x000A;  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#x000A;  free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#x000A;  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#x000A;  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#x000A;  system.&#x000A;&#x000A;    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#x000A;  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#x000A;  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#x000A;  that program using a modified version of the Library.&#x000A;&#x000A;    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#x000A;  modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#x000A;  &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#x000A;  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#x000A;  be combined with the library in order to run.&#x000A;&#x000A;                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#x000A;     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#x000A;&#x000A;    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#x000A;  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#x000A;  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#x000A;  this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#x000A;  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#x000A;&#x000A;    A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#x000A;  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#x000A;  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#x000A;&#x000A;    The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#x000A;  which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#x000A;  Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#x000A;  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#x000A;  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#x000A;  straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#x000A;  included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#x000A;&#x000A;    &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#x000A;  making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#x000A;  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#x000A;  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#x000A;  and installation of the library.&#x000A;&#x000A;    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#x000A;  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#x000A;  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#x000A;  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#x000A;  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#x000A;  writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#x000A;  and what the program that uses the Library does.&#x000A;&#x000A;    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's&#x000A;  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#x000A;  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#x000A;  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#x000A;  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#x000A;  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#x000A;  Library.&#x000A;&#x000A;    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#x000A;  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#x000A;  fee.&#x000A;&#x000A;    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#x000A;  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#x000A;  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#x000A;  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#x000A;&#x000A;      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#x000A;&#x000A;      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#x000A;      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#x000A;&#x000A;      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#x000A;      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#x000A;&#x000A;      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#x000A;      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#x000A;      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#x000A;      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#x000A;      in the event an application does not supply such function or&#x000A;      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#x000A;      its purpose remains meaningful.&#x000A;&#x000A;      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#x000A;      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#x000A;      application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#x000A;      application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#x000A;      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#x000A;      root function must still compute square roots.)&#x000A;&#x000A;  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#x000A;  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#x000A;  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#x000A;  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#x000A;  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#x000A;  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#x000A;  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#x000A;  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#x000A;  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#x000A;  it.&#x000A;&#x000A;  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#x000A;  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#x000A;  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#x000A;  collective works based on the Library.&#x000A;&#x000A;  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#x000A;  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#x000A;  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#x000A;  the scope of this License.&#x000A;&#x000A;    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#x000A;  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#x000A;  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#x000A;  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#x000A;  instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#x000A;  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#x000A;  that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#x000A;  these notices.&#x000A;&#x000A;    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#x000A;  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#x000A;  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#x000A;&#x000A;    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#x000A;  the Library into a program that is not a library.&#x000A;&#x000A;    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#x000A;  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#x000A;  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#x000A;  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#x000A;  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#x000A;  medium customarily used for software interchange.&#x000A;&#x000A;    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#x000A;  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#x000A;  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#x000A;  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#x000A;  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#x000A;&#x000A;    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#x000A;  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#x000A;  linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#x000A;  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#x000A;  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#x000A;&#x000A;    However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#x000A;  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#x000A;  contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#x000A;  library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#x000A;  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#x000A;&#x000A;    When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#x000A;  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#x000A;  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#x000A;  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#x000A;  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#x000A;  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#x000A;&#x000A;    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#x000A;  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#x000A;  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#x000A;  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#x000A;  work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#x000A;  Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#x000A;&#x000A;    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#x000A;  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#x000A;  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#x000A;  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#x000A;&#x000A;    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#x000A;  link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#x000A;  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#x000A;  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#x000A;  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse&#x000A;  engineering for debugging such modifications.&#x000A;&#x000A;    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#x000A;  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#x000A;  this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#x000A;  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#x000A;  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#x000A;  directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#x000A;  of these things:&#x000A;&#x000A;      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#x000A;      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#x000A;      changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#x000A;      Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#x000A;      with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#x000A;      uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#x000A;      user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#x000A;      executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#x000A;      that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#x000A;      Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#x000A;      to use the modified definitions.)&#x000A;&#x000A;      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#x000A;      Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#x000A;      copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,&#x000A;      rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#x000A;      will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#x000A;      the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#x000A;      interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#x000A;&#x000A;      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#x000A;      least three years, to give the same user the materials&#x000A;      specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#x000A;      than the cost of performing this distribution.&#x000A;&#x000A;      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#x000A;      from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#x000A;      specified materials from the same place.&#x000A;&#x000A;      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#x000A;      materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#x000A;&#x000A;    For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#x000A;  Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#x000A;  reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#x000A;  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#x000A;  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#x000A;  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#x000A;  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#x000A;  the executable.&#x000A;&#x000A;    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#x000A;  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#x000A;  accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#x000A;  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#x000A;  distribute.&#x000A;&#x000A;    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#x000A;  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#x000A;  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#x000A;  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#x000A;  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#x000A;  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#x000A;&#x000A;      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#x000A;      based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#x000A;      facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#x000A;      Sections above.&#x000A;&#x000A;      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#x000A;      that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#x000A;      where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#x000A;&#x000A;    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#x000A;  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#x000A;  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#x000A;  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#x000A;  rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#x000A;  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#x000A;  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#x000A;&#x000A;    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#x000A;  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#x000A;  distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#x000A;  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#x000A;  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#x000A;  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#x000A;  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#x000A;  the Library or works based on it.&#x000A;&#x000A;    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#x000A;  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#x000A;  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#x000A;  subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#x000A;  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.&#x000A;  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#x000A;  this License.&#x000A;&#x000A;    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#x000A;  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#x000A;  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#x000A;  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#x000A;  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#x000A;  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#x000A;  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#x000A;  may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#x000A;  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#x000A;  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#x000A;  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#x000A;  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#x000A;&#x000A;  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#x000A;  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#x000A;  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#x000A;&#x000A;  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#x000A;  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#x000A;  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#x000A;  integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#x000A;  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#x000A;  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#x000A;  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#x000A;  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#x000A;  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#x000A;  impose that choice.&#x000A;&#x000A;  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#x000A;  be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#x000A;&#x000A;    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#x000A;  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#x000A;  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#x000A;  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#x000A;  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#x000A;  excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#x000A;  written in the body of this License.&#x000A;&#x000A;    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#x000A;  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#x000A;  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#x000A;  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#x000A;&#x000A;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#x000A;  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#x000A;  &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#x000A;  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#x000A;  the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#x000A;  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#x000A;  the Free Software Foundation.&#x000A;&#x000A;    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#x000A;  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#x000A;  write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#x000A;  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#x000A;  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#x000A;  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#x000A;  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#x000A;  and reuse of software generally.&#x000A;&#x000A;                              NO WARRANTY&#x000A;&#x000A;    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#x000A;  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#x000A;  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#x000A;  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#x000A;  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#x000A;  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#x000A;  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#x000A;  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#x000A;  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#x000A;&#x000A;    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#x000A;  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#x000A;  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#x000A;  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#x000A;  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#x000A;  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#x000A;  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#x000A;  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#x000A;  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#x000A;  DAMAGES.&#x000A;&#x000A;                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#x000A;&#x000A;             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#x000A;&#x000A;    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#x000A;  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#x000A;  everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#x000A;  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#x000A;  ordinary General Public License).&#x000A;&#x000A;    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#x000A;  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#x000A;  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#x000A;  &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#x000A;&#x000A;      &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#x000A;      Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#x000A;&#x000A;      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#x000A;      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#x000A;      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#x000A;      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#x000A;&#x000A;      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#x000A;      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#x000A;      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#x000A;      Lesser General Public License for more details.&#x000A;&#x000A;      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#x000A;      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#x000A;      Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA&#x000A;&#x000A;  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#x000A;&#x000A;  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#x000A;  school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#x000A;  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#x000A;&#x000A;    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#x000A;    library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#x000A;&#x000A;    &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#x000A;    Ty Coon, President of Vice&#x000A;&#x000A;  That's all there is to it!</pre>
